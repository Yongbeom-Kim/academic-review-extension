3. Go to your Manage Extensions page.

## Notes

### Opening in Microsoft Excel
- The .csv file that is emitted is in `UTF-8` formatting, and you will likely experience some form of text display issues.
- To mitigate this,
  1. Open a new Excel file
  2. Go to `import from Text/CSV`
  3. Select the file you want to import
  4. The formatting should be good now!
