# About

This is a cross-browser extension to facilitate metadata research for the Raffles Bulletin of Zoology. This extension works by collecting automatically metadata from journal entries on the website and their PDFs.

Note that this extension only uses ManifestV2, so it has to be installed manually on browsers. After collecting said metadata, the extension will emit a `.csv` file.

This extension is built using React, PDFjs and bundled using esbuild.

## Installation
On Chrome,
1. Download the latest zip file in the [releases page](https://github.com/Yongbeom-Kim/academic-review-extension/releases)
2. Unzip your zip file
3. Go to your Manage Extensions page.
4. Turn on developer mode
5. Go to 'load unpacked' and select the file you just unzipped.
6. Your extension should be installed!

If you're on other browsers, you should have some similar version of these steps.

## Notes
### Known Issues
- Some journals have inconsistent formatting, and therefore all .csv files produced by these extensions have to be manually checked by hand. Example is [RBZ Volume 69](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/publications/raffles-bulletin-of-zoology/volumes/volume-69/), Corrigendum to Yasunaga T, Ch√©rot F & Schwartz MD (2021).

### Opening in Microsoft Excel
- The .csv file that is emitted is in `UTF-8` formatting, and you will likely experience some form of text display issues.
- To mitigate this,
  1. Open a new Excel file
  2. Go to `import from Text/CSV`
  3. Select the file you want to import
  4. The formatting should be good now!
